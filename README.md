###DevHack: Write non-disposable code with friends.  
> Code challenges sites are cute but they are not good neither for building a portfolio or making something useful for yourself and your friends. - Abraham van Hodgenville  

Create useful software by participating in **DevHack**  

There are two ways:

####1) You have an Idea for a project
Follow these steps

1. Create a repo  with a README.md describing what your idea is and what you are looking for. (see this example)
2. Go to the **[Participators list](#)** and submit your idea/project and your details. (send PR)
3. Find a team, create a waffle.io board and start hacking!

Tips:

* It's recommended to be the one who writes the first lines of code. Even before getting a team.
* You should take the role of development lead or assign a leader asap.
* Tell people when your team is complete. But it's a good idea to have somebody in reserve.

####2) You want to join others with their projects
 Follow these steps:
 
 1. Head over to **[Participators List](#)** and submit your details.
 2. Find a project you interested in and contact people with ideas (via Slack, email, GH issue)
 3. Start coding
